There is a little guy named Tom who is stupid and arrogant. One day little Tom is walking down the street and suddenly crashed by a car. He's died. His best friend Thomas The Fool is sad about that.

To memorize his dear friend Tom, Thomas decided to bury him. Weeks later, when Thomas walked by Tom's house in the night, he indistinctly saw a ghost. Thomas thought the ghost must be Tom. He missed Tom but he was scared by the ghost.

Tom spoke to his friends about it and together, they went to investigate. It was midnight and there was an eerie light coming from the house. They knocked the front door. No answer. "Let's try opening it," Frank said. Tom turned the door knob and the door opened. It was as if they have walked into a haunted house. There were no trace of life at all, yet somehow in the far back of the house, a greenish glow was visible.
