There is a little guy named Tom who is stupid and arrogant. One day little Tom is walking down the street and suddenly crashed by a car. He's died. His best friend Thomas The Fool is sad about that.

To memorize his dear friend Tom, Thomas decided to bury him. Weeks later, when Thomas walked by Tom's house in the night, he indistinctly saw a ghost. Thomas thought the ghost must be Tom. He missed Tom but he was scared by the ghost.

Tom spoke to his friends about it and together, they went to investigate. It was midnight and there was an eerie light coming from the house. They knocked the front door. No answer. "Let's try opening it," Frank said. Tom turned the door knob and the door opened. It was as if they have walked into a haunted house. There were no trace of life at all, yet somehow in the far back of the house, a greenish glow was visible.

Frank said, "I'll go in first." And he entered through the door into the room with the green light. Instantly he was pulled through the cracked doorway by a strong and sudden force. Thomas picked up a baseball bat he found sitting in the corner, for protection, and crept towards the glowing doorway. "Frank, are you there? Are you okay?" he whispered. But Frank gave no reponse. The only thing Thomas heard was a dripping substance... drip... drip...drip. Then, gathering what little courage he had, Thomas flung open the door with all his might. He raised the bat and took a fighting stance. However, what he found just confused him. 

What a great story! Now I'm finishing it.
